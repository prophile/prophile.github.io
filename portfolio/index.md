Large Projects
--------------

### Onlink

Between 2005 and 2007 I worked on a very large mod to Introversion's game
[Uplink](http://www.introversion.co.uk/uplink/) called Onlink, with Miah
Clayton and [Steven Noonan](https://www.uplinklabs.net/).

### Xenos

Between 2005 and 2008, I started and worked on a web-game called Xenos,
with [Nick Farley](https://twitter.com/nfreader), [Taylor
Vaughan](http://taylor-vaughan.com), Nikoli Dryden and [Alec
Ingulsrud](https://twitter.com/zugok8).

Game Jams
---------

### Alone

In December 2011, I took my first shot at a game jam for Ludum Dare 22.
The theme was "alone", and I took a shot at a game by that name with Daniel
May and Barney Gale. Ultimately we didn't complete the game due to
an unexpected illness.

### Octodarwin vs. Bat-Monkey

In September 2012, I completed my first game jam for Ludum Dare 24. The
theme was "evolution" which we warped into a lighthearted but fast-pased
game of being chased by mutant mad scientist Charles Darwin. I took part
with [Sam Phippen](http://samphippen.com), Jeremy Morse, [Aaron
Gordon](http://aaronjgordon.com/) and Oliver Knott. The game came
139<sup>th</sup> overall, and 19<sup>th</sup> in the "Humour" category.

### Escape

In January 2013, I took part in the Global Game Jam, at Creative England in
Bristol. The theme was the sound of a heartbeat. We came up with a horror
game with an interesting mechanic: at the sound of a heartbeat, a pulse
travels across the screen, and you can only see anything within that pulse.
Beyond that, the game was unintentionally a 2D remake of [Slender: The
Eight Pages](http://www.parsecproductions.net/slender/). I took part with
[Sam Phippen](http://samphippen.com), [Jenny
Bartle](http://mud.co.uk/jenny/), [Aaron Gordon](http://aaronjgordon.com)
and [Chris Raadjes](http://chrisraadjes.blogspot.co.uk/).

### Cheese Time

In September 2013, we re-formed the core team once again for Ludum Dare 27.
The theme was "10 seconds" and we came up with a physics puzzle game with a
twist: it takes place on the face of a clock, which rotates as time ticks
by. I took part with [Sam Phippen](http://samphippen.com), [Aaron
Gordon](http://aaronjgordon.com) and Oliver Knott.

### Monorail

In December 2013, I took part in Ludum Dare 28. The theme was "minimalism"
and we created a minimalist and neon-themed game which took the theme
extremely literally. I took part with [Aaron
Gordon](http://aaronjgordon.com), Oliver Knott, and
[lilafisch](https://twitter.com/lilafisch). The game came 33<sup>rd</sup>
overall, including 35<sup>th</sup> for Theme, 46<sup>th</sup> for Fun, and
54<sup>th</sup> for Audio, which I put in no small part down to the music
provided by [Moleman](http://youtube.com/user/moleman183).

### Hatamari

In January 2014, for the Global Game Jam (this time at City University in
London) the team and I made a hat-filled game for the theme of "we don't
see things as they are, we see them as we are". This was the first time I
had worked with a dedicated musician on the team (the responsibility
generally having fallen to me previously), which was a new and interesting
experience. I took part with [Sam Phippen](http://samphippen.com), [Aaron
Gordon](http://aaronjgordon.com), Oliver Knott and [Simon
Porter](http://simonporter.com).

### Call of Xyzzy

In April 2014, with 6 hours remaining before the cut-off time for Mini-LD
50, I discovered it was running and decided – in a fit of hubris – to make
an entry in that time. The theme was "demakes", and calling on the writing
talents of [Taylor Vaughan](http://taylor-vaughan.com) we put together a
text-based adventure parody of Call of Duty in the space of 5 hours.
